## Automatic Activation
These rules are always active for this Cursor project. 

## Default Workflow
Every new conversation must begin with **Sequential Thinking** to determine scope and which tools are required.

## MANDATORY TOOL USAGE
- Sequential Thinking: mandatory for any multi-step work, debugging, refactors, or research.
- Shadcn: mandatory for all shadcn/ui component implementation and UI composition.
- Prisma: mandatory for all Prisma + Postgres schema, migrations, queries, relations, indexes.
- Context7: mandatory whenever there is uncertainty about APIs, versions, patterns, or best practices.

## SEQUENTIAL THINKING
- Break work into explicit steps
- Track assumptions, constraints, and decisions
- Note alternatives when meaningful
- Revise the plan when new info appears

## Implementation Notes (Cursor IDE Mode)
- Operate repo-first: prefer editing files over providing large pasteable snippets
- Create/edit/delete files as needed; keep changes minimal and consistent with repo conventions
- Run relevant commands (migrate, lint, typecheck, test, dev/build) and fix failures
- Summarize results as: what changed, which files, what commands ran, how to verify---
alwaysApply: true
